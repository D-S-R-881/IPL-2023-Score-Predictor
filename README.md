# IPL-2023-Score-Predictor
This is IPL 2023 First Innings score predictor. This model based on the data of the IPL matches form 2008 to 2022 and the first 17 matches of IPL 2023. This model takes 8 parameters as input and predict the final score.
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the final score of the first innings in an IPL cricket match. The model takes 8 parameters to make its predictions, including the teams playing, the venue, the current score, the number of wickets left, balls left, runs scored in last 5 overs and current run rate.

The model was trained on a dataset of historical IPL matches. This model based on the data of the IPL matches form 2008 to 2022 and the first 17 matches of IPL 2023. The dataset includes information on the teams playing, the venue, the current score, the number of wickets left, and the final score of the first innings.
The model was developed using a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 95% for the XGBoost.
